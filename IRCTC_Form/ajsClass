dependecy injection
modules ,appes and controllesrs
anatomy of angular applicatiion


Angular js:
 it is a framwork of js.
 	uses: we write lot of code for mad dynamic  app.
 	simple and syncronixation sim

 	create more dynamicness to  app

 	it provide interface and sevices , facilitys 
 	client side tech.
 	html template lang 

 	Help to deve:
 		provides  structer to fule with code easlly
 		follow the module level approch(less errors).
 		Dependency injection
 		Testing
 		Ajax services(allows to use commuincate web servers)
 		helps in creation of RIA (reach Internet application) means add all fecilitys now a days.

 	failures:
 		less secure
 		Not degradable(browser not support JS  AJS not use)
 	Who controls:
 		Open source  funded by google

 	diff others:
 		SPA
 		html to give ti native MVC capabulity	



 	MV*(Modle conrol  anything) is  application design patteren
 	 in order to manage code 

 	 app logic (v)(it respone to  user req send date)
 	 bussiness logic(c)(user has pass instruction by event)
 	 DB logid(M)(allow to intract to user)


 	 mvvm(model to view , view to model)



 	 Add AJS in HTML:
 	 	1. add library
 	 	2.<html ng-app=""> to set interpiter.
 	 ng-  likt it start it is customized attributs to add to html.

 	 	ng-modle ="name" --------------->input date
 	 	{{name}}--------------->output data 
 	 	Here bind the date
 	 	here "name" is application varible 

 	 	rc(relese condidate)

 	 remove white space it calls min file

 	  one way and two data binding is there(user interface to modle  not modle to ui)
 		if sadisby  then it is two way



 		two way data bind



 			var myApp = angular.mdule("myapp" , []);
 			member apperator indicatro



 	$scope having varible and function(db and veiw access  this scope)
 	$filter format the contern

 	Module/appliaciton :
 	app is name of module.
 	it is container  represtnr a part of app

 	is a block and fragment in page
 	it having controlers(evry contoler having one $scope it is default)
 	it containg or connect to someny  aspects



contolers:
all behavier  of modlules we create,
it hold data some period of time



vat myapp = angular.module("muapp" ,[]);

 	Interpolation:
 	combaining string and place holde.
 	it like sting concatination

 	 js object   it is a app obje
 	 special property both modle and view access same  varible




 	 one html page having may modules?
 	 nesed modules is existing?



28/10/16  :
	

	Dependency injection:
	 passing object as a parameter to one functio to another function
	 inject some depenceny to particular function.


	 three ways to store dependency:

		 in controler finction   create dependency

		 golbal

		 invoke a () send a dependency


	 it is a design patteren

	 hardCode:
		 	if create local ver in fuction  it is hotcoded (static)
		
		 for removeing hardcode remove we interduce dependency INjectuon

		  any element u use anglerjs is called component
		  note: when  html element has event fire the instance will create in  NG
	$inject :
		responce for fond the object instantioation create

	consumer: is a html where u invock the function

	annotatite():
		inline and extranal(explicitly) annotatioe

		inline :
			contorl a array how may paramerers we required



	Scope in  NG:
		it provide service/interface

	watchers and digest loop  :                         anhancement
		js has maintian all events in one file
		 and every time checkong event has happens by loop that loop is  called event loop.

		 some watchers has intement o eventloop  and create 
	Dirty checking:
		it checking old value and new value 
		watch collection:
		evalAsync List


		$scop.$apply():
		scope evvent propagation
		this total process is colled digest loop.










 	 Interpiter
Q. current version
modle and app same


crick buzz check table balues to other  files
try to creat  resterent form 

two way data bind assingment





31/10/16:
 Events in angulr ja:

 	propagated   accrose one scope to an other scope  (sharing)
 	 $emiting() -------------calce  is ther for event

 	 $broadcast();

 	 $on() only registor  with the particural ivent  those contolar only share the data,


 	Expressions:
 		what ever statement that producing value is called expression.

 		bindingexpression -{{}}
 		ng-bing


 		eval(),$parse
 		forgiving
 		Context

 		parsing:

 	InterPolation  sting


 	forms:
